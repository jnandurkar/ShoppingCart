# Shopping Cart Application

# Problem statement 
Epic Context
A big retail brand outlet, on the eve of Christmas, we want to offer attractive seasonal discounts to our
customers to boost our retail sales.
Story#1
As a retail outletâ€™s salesman, I should be able to calculate the customer's shopping cart bill after considering
applicable discount rates that are based on the purchase amount and customer type so that our retail outlet
can maximize sales volume & value.
Discount Slabs for various purchase amounts for the regular and premium customers are as follows:
Customer Type: Regular 
Purchase Amount Slab Discount % 
$0 - $ 5,000 = Nil 
$ 5,000 - $10,000 10% 
$10,000 & above 20% 

Customer Type: Premium
Purchase Amount Slab Discount %
$ 0 - $ 4,000 10%
$ 4,000 - $ 8,000 15%
$ 8,000 - $ 12,000 20%
$ 12,000 & above 30%

Note:
Total discount would be the sum of discount calculated for each slab.
E.g. For purchase of $15,000 by a regular customer would entitle total discount $1500 which is sum of
discount $500 for 2nd slab [10% of $(10000-5000)] & $1000 discount for 3rd slab [20% of $(15000-10000)].
